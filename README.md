## About Me

I am a computer science undergraduate and an avid user of the pomodoro technique. <br/>
I wanted to practice my web development skills on something I would actually use, so **Tomatera** was born. <br/>

Fun Fact: _Tomatera_ is Spanish for "tomato plant," which is inspired by _pomodoro_ being the Italian translation for "tomato."
